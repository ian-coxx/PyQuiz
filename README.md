What is PyQuiz?
	PyQuiz is a study tool to help students prepare for a quiz, text, exam, or anything else of the sort.
The tool allows users to enter terms to study along with their definitions and gives different options of
modes to play to practice learning and mastering the terms.
- The first game mode is flashcards where the player cycles through their terms, and “flips” each separate card to find
a term’s definition. The player also has the option to star a term after studying it, and at the end of the flashcards,
they can study their starred terms for extra practice.
- The second game mode is multiple choice. The player is given questions on each of their terms and up to 4 options are
given to choose from for the definition. The game will tell them if they are correct or not.

Running and Testing the Program:
    After running the program, a message will come up which welcomes you to the game. The player then enters a term and
    a definition for that term. Then the player can either choose y (yes) or n (no) to either add another term and
    definition or to move on. Once the player is done adding terms and definitions, they can either choose 1 for the
    flashcards practice gamemode or 2 for the multiple choice game mode. If the flashcards gamemode is chosen, the
    player clicks enter to see the definition of the term at hand and can type "star" to star it or click enter to move
    on. At the end of the flashcards, the player can choose y (yes) or n (no) to either study starred terms or be done
    playing. If the player chooses the multiple choice gamemode, a term is shown and options are given of definitions.
    Only one is correct and the user has to type the number of the one they think is correct.

Extras:
